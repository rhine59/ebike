# Summary

In order to fit a Hailong Style Ebike battery to a bike frame the two bottle mount points are used. This does not support the battery weight very well, so I designed extra support brackets that include a cable clamp for the display cable I was using. 

I have also added a version without the cable clamp and versions for extra support that don't mount over the bottle cage mounts that are simply used as extra spacers 

All versions use standard cable ties to tie onto the bike frame and the ends are concealed for a very clean look (see pictures)

Please note this was designed for a steel bike frame with a 17.5mm downtube diameter, this may not be the same on your bike.
